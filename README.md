Hello, we are a group of Programmers from a VRC High School Organization, and we go by the 9185 number.
This prodject is an attempt to organize the likes of the LemLib, and Ez Templates into one cohersive file.
We also plan to work of other generally untilities for VRC use and will both include them here, but also as their own file meant to implamented into any PROS(And maybe even Vex Code Pro) Prodject.
